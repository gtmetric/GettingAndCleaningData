The set of variables includes:
activity            -> Kind of activity that was taken
subject             -> No. of subjects that took the activity
tBodyAcc-XYZ		-> Time domain Body Acceleration in X, Y, and Z directions
tGravityAcc-XYZ		-> Time domain Gravity Acceleration in X, Y, and Z directions
tBodyAccJerk-XYZ	-> Time domain Body Acceleration Jerk in X, Y, and Z directions
tBodyGyro-XYZ		-> Time domain Body Gyro in X, Y, and Z directions
tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ	-> Time domain Body Gyro Jerk signal in X, Y, and Z directions
tBodyAccMag         -> Time domain Body Acceleration magnitude in X, Y, and Z directions
tGravityAccMag      -> Time domain Gravity Acceleration magnitude in X, Y, and Z directions
tBodyAccJerkMag     -> Time domain Body Acceleration Jerk magnitude in X, Y, and Z directions
tBodyGyroMag        -> Time domain Body Gyro magnitude in X, Y, and Z directions
tBodyGyroJerkMag    -> Time domain Body Gyro Jerk magnitude in X, Y, and Z directions
fBodyAcc-XYZ        -> Frequency domain Body Acceleration in X, Y, and Z directions
fBodyAccJerk-XYZ    -> Frequency domain Body Acceleration Jerk in X, Y, and Z directions
fBodyGyro-XYZ       -> Frequency domain Body Gyro in X, Y, and Z directions
fBodyAccMag         -> Frequency domain Body Acceleration magnitude in X, Y, and Z directions
fBodyAccJerkMag     -> Frequency domain Body Acceleration Jerk magnitude in X, Y, and Z directions
fBodyGyroMag        -> Frequency domain Body Gyro magnitude in X, Y, and Z directions
fBodyGyroJerkMag    -> Frequency domain Body Gyro Jerk magnitude in X, Y, and Z directions

For each varible (except activity and subject), there are two estimations including:
mean()  -> Mean value
std()   -> Standard deviation
